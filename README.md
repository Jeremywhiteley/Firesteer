## The problem
Google offers what they call the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) to see what's in your database. It provides a simple (too simple) way to visualize each saved collections and documents.
However, the moment you'll gather more and more data, you'll have to play the game: "Let's click on my collection, then scroll... then click... then scroll... 
then "CMD (CTRL) + F" the document ID you are looking for, then..." and so on ! It becomes rapidly a real pain since you cannot 
make quick, simple and complete queries against your Firestore database. 

## This solution
Firesteer gives you the ability to create any queries on any collections and / or documents.
It also provides a simple and clear way to visualize your queries results (hey, better than making custom scripts in a terminal ?)
For those who would be familiar with MongoDB, Firesteer tends to offer the same features as [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org/) 

## Installation

1. TBD
2. get firestore private key
