# Firesteer

### A brilliant desktop application that gives you full control over your [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) database


## Install

And then install dependencies with yarn. (May take a while for first fresh install). Unfortunately since we use electron-rebuild package,
[yarn seems to be the only way](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#installation) to install dependencies correctly

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn run dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ yarn run start-renderer-dev
$ yarn run start-main-dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ yarn run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ yarn run package -- --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:
```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true npm run package
```

## How to add modules to the project

You will need to add other modules to this boilerplate, depending on the requirements of your project. For example, you may want to add [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) to communicate with PostgreSQL database, or 
[material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) to reuse react UI components.

⚠️ Please read the following section before installing any dependencies ⚠️

### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure). This means, you will have two `package.json` files.

1. `./package.json` in the root of your project
1. `./app/package.json` inside `app` folder

### Which `package.json` file to use

**Rule of thumb** is: all modules go into `./package.json` except native modules. Native modules go into `./app/package.json`.

1. If the module is native to a platform (like firebase-admin) or otherwise should be included with the published package (i.e. bcrypt, openbci), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json`.
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`.   See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md). Examples of such modules are `material-ui`, `redux-form`, and `moment`.
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

### Further Readings

See the wiki page, [Module Structure — Two package.json Structure](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/wiki/Module-Structure----Two-package.json-Structure) to understand what is native module, the rationale behind two package.json structure and more.

For an example app that uses this boilerplate and packages native dependencies, see [erb-sqlite-example](https://github.com/amilajack/erb-sqlite-example).
